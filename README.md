# mock_bank

Code test to create a mock bank for a hiring process. The code test was built in ruby, but I decided to redo it in Go for the practice.

The code test required the following:

- A client could create an account
- A client could transfer fake money
- A client could get their balance

The time for the code test should be between 2-3 hours.

# How to run

```go
go run main.go
// or
go build main.go
./main
```

Then go to localhost:8080 to be able to create your account, login and transfer some fake money
